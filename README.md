# YogaMates

YogaMates is a dating app for Yogis. It is made entirely using Flutter and BLoC.

## Introduction

YogaMates is an app which provides almost all the basic functionalities that are available in most dating apps and even more.
 
The user can sign up to the app using an email and password. They can setup their profile with necessary details. The app is then divided into three different sections: Searching, Matches and Chats. 

In the Searching section, the user can look at the other user profiles and like/dislike them. 

In the Matches section, the user would be able to see whom they have matches with and who has liked them. The user can then decide to like back and take it forward by chatting with them. 

The Chats section is a basic chat screen with all the user profiles listed out and the user can chat with the users they wish to do so. 

I use Firestore and Firebase to authenticate the users and store all the user data.
